I am currently a Professor in the Department of Statistics at the State University of Paraíba (UEPB). I hold a Ph.D. in Statistics and Agronomic Experimentation from ESALQ-USP (2024), an MBA in Data Science and Analytics from ESALQ-USP (2023), and a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from UFRN (2019). I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from UEPB in 2016.

My professional expertise focuses on Spatial Statistics, Linear and Generalized Linear Regression Models, Survival Analysis (including cure fraction models), GAMLSS, and Machine Learning, with a primary emphasis on model development and diagnostic methods.
